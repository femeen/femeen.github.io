For many women and teenagers today, they didn't grow up with the Barbie collection being multiracial. They grew up with the blue eyed blonde that have anything and everything she want. For almost every young girl wanted to own a Barbie and even more, to be Barbie. When young one is easily manipulated, so young girls seeing a girl like Barbie all over toy stores s d in commercial and seeing that she gets what she wants.But barbie is no longer the the doll it is models that women see i their every day life, from Victoria's Secret models to Instagram models. The strive to have a flat tommy,big boobs and butt along with thin thighs have been more than ever.Almost all instagram models have the perfect body, which seems to male their every action look good. Teen girls suck in the information of the perfect body and strive for it. wheather they have to go on diets or starve their self to accomplish it they will. Even little girls the ag of 8 are striving to have a "perfect" body.One being a young girl in second grade, she and her sisters are  both dancers and she see her sister have the perfect body for dancing in terms of having long skinny legs being tall and having a flat tommy. While she is short and her body isn't realy seen as a model for dancing. Because of this she gets insecure about her body and go on diets sometimes to try and get the body, when her body has not even matured yet. </h3>

<h3>A girl is raised to be perfection, they are told to not make mistakes at because ladies don't make mistakes, but men don't go through the same treatement. Men don't have tp be perfect but they do have to be brave. Just like women have to appear perfect, men have to appear strong and brave. I women can't take risks and a man can't cry. This is what society decided was actions allowed from both men and women. Example being jobs, women could work the same hours and job as a man and still get paid less because of their gender. This is not a man's, the things are the way they are because the business industry has yet to catch up with gender equaility.People have stop questioning if they are Barbie or Ken and they have start questioning if they are happy with who they are as people. </h3>
