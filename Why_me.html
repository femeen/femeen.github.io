<h3 id="donthead"> Don't Blame it on My Clothes</h3>

<p id="dontpara"> <img id="sheasked" src="sheasked.jpg" align="left"> Rape Culture is an environment where sexual harrasment/rape is being justified. From aggressors saying that "They asked for it" to the police asking "What were you wearing," society makes the victim feel as if it were their fault. When a guy takes advantage of a girl, society justifies it by saying, "Boys will be boys." It shouldn't matter what a person is wearing. It shouldn't matter what state they were in. It shouldn't matter what gender, race or any characteristics that person is. If a person doesn't say the word "yes" then it automatically should mean NO! Society decides to blame the victim because they want to differenciate themselves from them. Doing this allows them to feel safe and protected. They think "Since I'm not like them, Since I don't dress like that, Since I'm not of the same gender, Since I'm not of the same race, this will not happen to me." That's not the case at all. Truth is no one asks to be sexually assualted and no one ever expects it to be them. Same goes for victims of domestic violence. The agressor justifies his harmful actions towards the victim by saying "You made me mad" or saying "I was jealous." In fact at times they will justify themselves by saying, "Everyone acts like that." Victims don't only get physically but also mentally abused. They will find themselves trying everything in the power to please their partner so they dont have to bear any pain. </p>
