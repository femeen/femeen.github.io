<h3 id = "donthate">Is feminism only for women?</h3>
<p id = "pinecones"> <img class = "womenintheworkplace" src = "antimen.jpg" align = "left" width="400px" height="400px">There are many reasons why people decide to go against feminism. I common reason is because some people believe that feminism is a movement against men. That feminist strive to make women above men not equal to men. Other people don't think that feminism doesn’t benefit men in any way. However, feminism is a movement for men and women to be equal to one another socially, politically and economically. In fact equality between men and women benefit both genders in many different ways. Given that women make up almost half of the workforce, their integration had huge positive ripple effects in all industries. Feminism has also successfully overturned laws that discriminated against men. For example the case, Craig v. Boren, was filled by a plaintiff in Oklahoma over its gender-specific drinking age policy, which prohibited men from drinking before age 21, but allowed women to drink when as young as 18. This implied that men are more reckless and women are more responsible. After the law was struck down, the drinking age became 21 for all. Another example, is that until recently the FBI’s definition of rape was old-fashioned and only including a man violating a women. That is, until feminist activists decided to change that. Thanks to the "Rape Is Rape" campaign launched by the Feminist Majority Foundation and Ms. magazine, more than 160,000 emails were sent to the FBI pressuring it to change its archaic definition of rape. The old definition, "carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will," hadn't been changed since 1921. It meant that many types of sexual assaults, including the rape of men, weren't counted as part of the bureau's annual Uniform Crime Report. When the decision was announced, then-VP and General Counsel of the Feminist Majority Foundation Kim Gandy said, "This is a major policy change and will dramatically impact the way rape is tracked and reported nationwide." Feminism doesn't only benefit women, it benefits people of all characters in different ways. Most people who are against feminism don't know the proper definition or have a misinterpretation of what feminism is. </p>

<h3> Teenager's opinion's on Feminism</h3>
<p class = "examples"> 
The opinion of a teenage boy: <br>
 “I believe in feminism because your gender shouldn't decide what you can and can't do. Men and women shouldn't be defined by their gender, they should be defined by who they are as people. We are born the same way and taught the same way, so to not let women have the same opportunities we do, just because they were born with different body parts, doesn't seem fair to me.”
<br>

<p class = "examples">
The opion of a teenage girl: <br>
 “I am a feminist because growing up in a household in which my mom was oppressed by my dad, and submissive to everything he said, I want girls my age to go out and make their own money and know that they are just as important as a male. That we don't have to depend on a man, we need to realize that those roles impressed upon us are not true. We are just as valuable as men, and we should be treated as such.”

The opinion of a teenage boy: <br> 
  “ Feminism in the western world is not needed. Women aren't being stoned for not wearing a burka or arguing with a man. Women are most free in western countries especially America.” </P>
